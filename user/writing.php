			<h1>5 SIMPLE WAYS TO IMPROVE YOUR WRITTEN ENGLISH :</h1><ol><br>
			<li><b>Expand your vocabulary</b>: To express yourself clearly, you need a good active vocabulary. That’s not just being able to recognise lots of words – it means actually being able to use them correctly. Do this by learning new words with example sentences, not just word lists.</li><br>
			<li><b>Master English spelling</b>: You must know how to spell those words correctly. Incorrect spelling changes the meaning of your sentence. For example: ‘bare’ and ‘bear’ sound the same but ‘bare’ means naked and ‘bear’ is a large animal. Additionally, incorrect spelling makes it difficult for the reader to understand what you’ve written.</li><br>
			<li><b>Read regularly</b>: People often say that we learn to write best by reading. Reading in English is useful in many ways. It is a great way to get an idea of the different styles of writing and see how to use words appropriately.</li><br>
			<li><b>Improve your grammar</b>: Grammar is very important because it improves the quality of your writing. Always use the appropriate tense and remember to use punctuation. Punctuation is a great way to make your writing clear and fluent.</li><br>
			<li><b>Just do it!</b>: Writing can be daunting. However, the best way to improve is get a pen and paper or sit in front of your computer and actually write. Be prepared to write several versions of each text because even for professional writers, the first draft is never perfect.</li>
